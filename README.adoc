tengi is designed as a cross-language communication platform. Using several distinct transport layers, tengi always finds the most efficient way to communicate between the client and server. +
Available transports range from a plain _TCP_ transmission over _RDP_ (a reliable UDP implementation), standard _UDP_ or _HTTP Long-Polling_ as fallback.



== Features
=== Cutting-Edge Technology

tengi implements industry standards like socket layer communication using _TCP_ and _UDP_ but also offers support cutting-edge technologies like _SCTP_ and _HTTP2_ for future perspective. By transparently offering a variety of transportation layers using a common, flexible but simple and easy-to-use API, tengi is class-leading for the cross-language communication sector.

=== Simplicity driven APIs

The famous quote '`if you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself`', by Albert Einstein, is not only true to Physics but also to software APIs. Complex APIs prevent people from using your solution or have a very flat learning curve and getting started is a hard task. +
Good APIs are easy readable, self explanatory and fast to get started with.

tengi, for this reason, hides complexity behind a simple but powerful API. An echo-server example is less than 20 lines of code but complex tasks can be achieved using a rich set of system-hooks for advanced users.

=== Data Protocol and Reliability

tengi's default protocol is a highly bandwidth optimized serialization and transmission solution. Supporting compressed _int32_ and _int64_ data types (when 64 bit types are supported by client languages) as well as providing way to serialize objects in custom way with guarantee of minimal overhead.

Depending on the selected transport layer additional overhead is necessary (e.g. _HTTP_, _HTTP2_). Due to the fact tengi always finds the best communication path, ending up using expensive transports is very unlikely. Still tengi supports communication through corporate firewalls and unreliable networks (e.g. mobile providers).

=== Asynchronous and Reactivity

Reactive design principles and event driven systems are most common way to start nowadays scalable solutions. Therefore tengi offers full support of the reactive pattern. From bottom up the internal implementation is completely based on a reactive design and this is also passed to the user.

=== Performance and the Java Power

More and more developers start using Java, or better said the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), as the foundation for their backend technologies. Powerful JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation and optimization based on runtime behavior bundled with the automatic resource management are a perfect base for server systems. In addition tengi is optimized for high performance, low latency and minimal Garbage Collector pressure.

Using latest Java 8 features like Closures (Lambdas), interface evolution and optimized data structures provides a compact and future-oriented external API.

=== Cross-Language Clients

tengi is designed to provide a simple communication protocol. The protocol specification is fully documented and easy to implement on further languages.

Currently planned clients include, but are not limited to, C#, C++, HTML5 (using ASM.js) and ActionScript, next to an obvious Java client.

== Protocol Specification

This chapter describes the tengi internal default protocol and serialization techniques.

It contains information about the available built-in data types, their sizes and value ranges. In addition it describes the the protocol and packet headers, as well as definitions how compression and serialization of certain special types is handled.

The tengi default protocol is designed to be low overhead and any kind of object is expected as *non-null* by default. Values that can be null must be written explicitly and adding a marker byte to the stream.

[NOTE]
====
Even if most computer architecture these days as based on Little Endian, the protocol is completely implemented to the rules of Big Endian. If a system based on Little Endian encoding is used, conversion between Little Endian and Big Endian is necessary before writing or after reading the byte stream.
====

=== Codec (Encoder, Decoder)

The `com.noctarius.tengi.serialization.codec.Codec` class consists of two sub-interfaces which should never be implemented independently but always as a complete codec.

A `Codec` defines a way to serialize and de-serialize values of a predefined set of special built-in types and objects of various, user defined types.

tengi, by default, offers a low-overhead and fast codec implementation which is automatically picked up and instantiated.

The `Codec` provides reader and writer methods for the distinct data types and two methods to read or write objects. `Codec::writeObject` writes *non-null* objects and throws an exception when null is passed to the method. `Codec::writeNullableObject` offers an automatic way to handle values that possibly can be null. It adds an extra Byte to the stream to mark the value to be null or not.

=== Int32 Compression

The Int32 Compression can be used to write Int32 values that are expected to be quite small in most cases but might exceed the range of smaller data types in certain cases.

[NOTE]
====
Int32 Compression is *not* supported per `Encoder::writeObject` but needs to be used explicitly using `Encoder::writeCompressedInt32` and read by `Decoder::readCompressedInt32`. Integers written with `Encoder::writeObject` will always be written as uncompressed Int32 values.
====

The actual Int32 will be compressed into one to five bytes. Due to the nature of how the compression works the biggest values need a few additional bits to store required metadata, therefore an additional byte is necessary. That said the Compressed Int32 is only recommended for generally small values.

Bits of the value are stores left to right. However the first byte can only store 5 bits and uses the most significant bit to store the original signed bit and the second most significant bit stores information if the final value needs to be inverted before being returned.

The later information is necessary to nicely compress, near zero, negative  or big values. When values are meant to be stored as an inverted bit sequence is up to the encoder implementation. A recommended way is to compare leading zeros in inverted and non-inverted form to take the better compressable version.

The least signification bit of every byte stores if another byte is about to follow up.

Content bits are stored from right to left in Big Endian encoding, unneccesary content bits in the first byte must be set to 0.

```
0               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|S|I| Content |F|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

.First Byte Bits
|===
| Bits | Description | Values

| 0
| Signed Bit
| Stores the signed bit of the original value

| 1
| Inverted Bit
| Stores if the final value needs to be inverted

| 2-6
| Content Bits
| Stores up to 5 bits

| 7
| Follow (F)
| 0 if stream ends, 1 if chunk follows
|===

Every following byte stores 7 additional bit of data and again a follow up bit.

```
0               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   Content   |F|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

.Further Byte Bits
|===
| Bits | Description | Values

| 0-6
| Content Bits
| Stores up to 6 bits

| 7
| Follow (F)
| 0 if stream ends, 1 if chunk follows
|===

As an example on how to apply this logic in the real world let's have a look at the following section.

Given is a value
```
A:Int32 = -2147483648 (minimal Int32 value)
```

This transformed into the bit representation as an integer looks like:

```
0               1               2               3               4
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

After storing the signed bit we can remove it and count the leading zeros which results in another 32 leading zeros and 0 writeable bits. In this example no additional invertation is applied and we store the minimal Int32 in one byte as follows:

```
0               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Another example is:

```
B:Int32 = -10;
```

In this case the binary representation looks like:

```
0               1               2               3               4
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1|1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1|1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1|1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Storing the signed bit and applying value invertion we result in:

```
0               1               2               3               4
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Obviously the value now can be stored in way less bits again. Counting leading zeros and calculating values to write we end up with `leadingZeros=28` and `writeableBits=4`. After writing the value to the byte stream we again end up with one byte of content.

```
0               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

=== Int64 Compression

The Int64 Compression works exactly as the Int32 compression but can store more information.It is used to write Int64 values that are expected to be quite small in most cases but might exceed the range of smaller data types in certain cases.

[NOTE]
====
Int64 Compression is *not* supported per `Encoder::writeObject` but needs to be used explicitly using `Encoder::writeCompressedInt64` and read by `Decoder::readCompressedInt64`. Integers written with `Encoder::writeObject` will always be written as uncompressed Int64 values.
====

The actual Int64 will be compressed into one to five bytes. Due to the nature of how the compression works the biggest values need a few additional bits to store required metadata, therefore an additional byte is necessary. That said the Compressed Int64 is only recommended for generally small values.

Bits of the value are stores left to right. However the first byte can only store 5 bits and uses the most significant bit to store the original signed bit and the second most significant bit stores information if the final value needs to be inverted before being returned.

The later information is necessary to nicely compress, near zero, negative  or big values. When values are meant to be stored as an inverted bit sequence is up to the encoder implementation. A recommended way is to compare leading zeros in inverted and non-inverted form to take the better compressable version.

The least signification bit of every byte stores if another byte is about to follow up.

Content bits are stored from right to left in Big Endian encoding, unneccesary content bits in the first byte must be set to 0.

```
0               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

```

As an example on how to apply this logic in the real world let's have a look at the following section.

Given is a value
```
A:Int64 = -9223372036854775808 (minimal Int64 value)
```

This transformed into the bit representation as an integer looks like:

```
0               1               2               3               4
5               6               7               8               9
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

After storing the signed bit we can remove it and count the leading zeros which results in another 64 leading zeros and 0 writeable bits. In this example no additional invertation is applied and we store the minimal Int32 in one byte as follows:

```
0               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Another example is:

```
B:Int64 = -10;
```

In this case the binary representation looks like:

```
0               1               2               3               4
5               6               7               8               9
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Storing the signed bit and applying value invertion we result in:

```
0               1               2               3               4
5               6               7               8               9
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

Obviously the value now can be stored in way less bits again. Counting leading zeros and calculating values to write we end up with `leadingZeros=60` and `writeableBits=4`. After writing the value to the byte stream we again end up with one byte of content.

```
0               1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

=== BitSet Compression

A BitSet is compressed using a chunk based encoding. Every chunk has a minium and maximum size. Chunk types are selected based on the number of necessary content slots.

Chunks are named as `Single`, `Double`, `Quad` after the numbers of bytes used to represent them. A `Single` chunk is the only chunk that can be used to store no element which represents a *NULL* value for the serialized BitSet.

The actual content is *always* written from left to right. That said, a `Single` chunk is filled from bit 4 onwards with data.

[[chunk-type-signature]] Chunks are marked using the first two bits of a stream as defined in the following table:

.Chunk Type Signature
|===
|Chunk Type | Octal | Binary

| Single
| 0x01
| 0b01

| Double
| 0x02
| 0b10

| Quad
| 0x03
| 0b11
|===

The last bit of a chunk always indicates if another chunk is going to follow or not. If another chunk follows up, the first two following bits again show the chunk type and encoding starts over with the same procedure.

It is up to the compressor implementation on how to select the individual chunks but it is recommended to select the best combination of chunks. For example 11 values can be stored as a `Double` and a `Single`, no matter in which order those two chunks appear, therefore it is optimal to start using `Quad` with at least 14 values.

==== Single Chunk

A `Single` chunk is represented by a single byte and can hold 1 to 3 content slots and the special value *NULL* which is represented as a zero-length chunk.

==== Double Chunk

A `Double` chunk is represented by two byte and can hold between 4 to 10 content slots. Due to the minimum number of content slots and the given number of bits to store the element count, the read element count from the bits need to be added to the minimum.

Example: +
0b001 = 1 +
1 + 4 = 5

```

==== Quad Chunk

A `Quad` chunk is represented by four byte and can hold between 11 to 25 content slots. Due to the minimum number of content slots and the given number of bits to store the element count, the read element count from the bits need to be added to the minimum.

Example: +
0b0011 = 3 +
3 + 11 = 14
